Emulator for the NES written in rust.

Many have come before and many will come after - but this is repository represents my exploration and learning by not referencing other emulators and relying only on available documentation to deliver an NES emulator that is cycle accurate, but (in the future) is capable of modestly up-scaling of various features.

I mostly want to play some games that are nostalgic to me - while challenging myself on a technical level.
